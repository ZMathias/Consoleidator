## A tiny and fast tool for extending command-line functionality and ease of use.
### Everything is triggered by a customizable shortcut, and the action will carried out on the ***foreground window***.
### Runs in the background and gives easy access to otherwise hard to change command-line properties only available through the system API, like:
- Changing foreground and background color of text by a customizable shortcut.
- Maximizing or changing the console buffer size.
- Quickly erasing the contents of the command-line, even while it's being written to or when the prompt is unavailable. This is also triggered by a shortcut.
- Setting the title of the window.

Doesn't yet work with Windows Terminal, though that will be fixed soon.

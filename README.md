## A tiny tray utility for extending the functionality of the command line.
### Gives access through shortcuts to system API only command-line functionality on the fly to multiple cmd windows even when STDOUT is being written to:
- Changing foreground and background colours of the terminal on the fly.
- Maximizing or changing the console buffer size.
- Clearing the output buffer of the console even while another process is being executed in the console.
- Setting a custom title for the window.

## Quick accent typer
Type any accented character by combining the base letter with the corresponding accent character. 

For example

## Getting started
Open up a cmd window and press CTRL + SHIFT + H and find out all the keyboard shortcuts.
The executable runs in the tray and acts upon the foreground command-line window. This enables operation on multiple windows at the same time.
